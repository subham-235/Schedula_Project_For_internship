# Schedula — Day 1 Internship Implementation

A complete mock-first doctor booking workflow built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Day 1 features

- Project setup and local run
- Responsive patient landing page
- Mock patient/doctor login flow with validation
- Doctor listing
- Search by doctor name or specialty
- Filter by specialty and location
- Doctor profile page
- Available appointment slots
- Date and time selection
- Patient details validation
- Booking confirmation
- Browser-local booking persistence
- Existing appointment API route preserved
- Doctor dashboard that merges starter appointments with locally created bookings

## Important architecture note

This is intentionally a Day 1 mock implementation. There is no production database, authentication provider, payment integration or email provider yet.

The starter `/api/appointments` route is kept because it already exists in the provided project. Patient-created bookings are stored in `localStorage`, so the doctor dashboard can demonstrate the full workflow without adding backend infrastructure.
